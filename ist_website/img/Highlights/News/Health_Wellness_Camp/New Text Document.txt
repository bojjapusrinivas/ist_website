Our company’s strength and success depend on our people. They spend many hours of the day together and we want to make sure that our work-place helps them maintain or even improve their health. Good health is a resource that helps us all meet our goals.
In this regard, we organized a Health & Wellness Camp at our Hyderabad delivery center in association with DocOnline, our health partner. A panel of qualified Doctors and Nursing Staff from DocOnline provided Stress Management sessions followed by health care services for all our employees. As well, a free Mobile app was given to all to consult a panel of Doctors anytime and resolve health-related queries of employee and their family. iSpatialTec ensures everyone to live healthier and happier lives, both at work and at home.
